  <a>xbox auto-like bot | activity feed farmer</a>

* horrible code
* your token will not show when you enter it due to the input method using GetPass.

* requirements
  - Python 3.9
  - asyncio
  - aiohttp
  - getpass
  - colorama



*There is a pre-made list in which was filled with active "Like4Like" profiles to be targeted, for easy growth. There is also a list with over 1 million targets that were scraped, located in the friends list scraper folder. Although this is old, and the targets haven't been filtered/updated to active L4L/S4S/A4A profiles, this is the only existing auto-like "bot" currently, and has been for a time.*

*This script will help you attract attention to your Xbox profile, as well as help you gain real followers, post likes, post comments, post shares and views.*

*I made this a long time ago and forgot about it. The code is probably horrible as all my projects are horribly written :)*
